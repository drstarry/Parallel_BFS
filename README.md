# Compute Centrality using Parallel BFS

## Centrality

[Centrality](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Centrality) defines how important a vertice in a graph. If one vertice shows
 frequently in shortest path among any other two vertices, it must have high centrality. The computation of 
 centrality is useful in the area of social networks.
