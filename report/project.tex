%       * Degree
%       * Closeness
%       * Betweeness
%       * Page Rank!
%       * Many More: Eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, Percolation
%         centrality, Cross-clique centrality, Freeman Centralization
%     * Why is it important

In graph theory, centrality indicates the importance of a vertex in the
network. This concept is naturally applied on social network analysis. Imagine
you are producing a new product and want to find beta users. It's simple to let
users with high centrality to use and spread the news to their reachable
networks.

There are many different definitions of centrality, eg. degree centrality,
closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. In our project, we will use
the vertex betweenness centrality, which is defined as:
\[ g(v) = \sum_{s\neq v \neq t}{\frac{\delta_{st}(v)}{\delta_{st}}} \]

Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge
along the shortest path between two other nodes. It's not hard to imagine that
the computation of centrality is very expensive with all the operations with
shortest paths. Our goal of this project is parallel such computation and
leverage the technology of MPI/OPENMP we learned in class.

We will explain two algorithms we use for parallel centrality computation, with
experiments, result, and analysis.

\section{Related Work} % 2. related work
\label{sec:related-work}
%     * How have other people already approached this problem
%     * The best known algorithms for differenet types of centrality
%     * Algorithms we looked at
%     * Floyd-Warshall $O(V^3)$
%     * Brandes $O(VE)$

Centrality was first introduced as a measure for quantifying the control of a
human on the communication between other humans in a social network by Linton
Freeman\cite{burt2009structural} In his conception. Ever since, the concept has
drawn many interests in cross-indiscipline area like network analysis and
social science.

Betweenness centralities in a graph involve calculating the shortest paths
between all pairs of vertices on a graph, which requires $\Theta(V^3)$ time
with the Floydâ€“Warshall\cite{Cormen:2001:IA:580470} algorithm. On sparse
graphs, Johnson's\cite{johnson1977efficient} algorithm may be more efficient,
taking $O(V^2 \log V + V E)$ time. In the case of unweighted graphs the
calculations can be done with Brandes' algorithm\cite{brandes2001faster} which
takes $\Theta(VE)$ time. Normally, these algorithms assume that graphs are
undirected and connected with the allowance of loops and multiple edges. When
specifically dealing with network graphs, often graphs are without loops or
multiple edges to maintain simple relationships (where edges represent
connections between two people or vertices). In this case, using Brandes'
algorithm will divide final centrality scores by 2 to account for each shortest
path being counted twice.

Breadth first search is also a great part in centrality computation as for the
shortest path part. Parallel BFS algorithms have
